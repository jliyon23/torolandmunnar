# Final Status Check - Toroland Munnar Dynamic Content

## ✅ Database Schema Verification

### Activities Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- title (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- description (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- image_url (TEXT, NOT NULL) ✓
- display_order (INTEGER, DEFAULT 0)
- is_published (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT true)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### Rooms Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- title (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- description (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- size (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- guests (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- bed (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- image (TEXT, NOT NULL) ✓
- display_order (INTEGER, DEFAULT 0)
- is_published (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT true)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## ✅ Field Mapping Verification

### Experiences Component (Activities)
**Frontend (Experiences.jsx):**
- Uses: `experience.image_url` ✓
- Uses: `experience.title` ✓
- Uses: `experience.description` ✓
- Filter: `activity.is_published` ✓

**Admin Panel (ActivitiesManager.jsx):**
- Saves to: `image_url` ✓
- Field names match database schema ✓

### Rooms Component
**Frontend (Rooms.jsx):**
- Uses: `room.image` ✓
- Uses: `room.title` ✓
- Uses: `room.description` ✓
- Uses: `room.size` ✓
- Uses: `room.guests` ✓
- Uses: `room.bed` ✓
- Filter: `room.is_published` ✓

**Admin Panel (RoomsManager.jsx):**
- Saves to: `image` ✓
- Field names match database schema ✓

## ✅ Visibility Fix Applied

All components now use `useState(true)` for initial visibility to avoid opacity-0 issues:

1. ✓ Experiences.jsx
2. ✓ Rooms.jsx
3. ✓ Voice.jsx (Testimonials)
4. ✓ BlogSection.jsx
5. ✓ About.jsx (Team)
6. ✓ Gallery.jsx
7. ✓ Hero.jsx
8. ✓ WhyToroland.jsx
9. ✓ Highlights.jsx

## ✅ Admin Panel Status

All admin managers created and functional:
1. ✓ RoomsManager.jsx
2. ✓ ActivitiesManager.jsx
3. ✓ TestimonialsManager.jsx
4. ✓ TeamManager.jsx
5. ✓ ImagesManager.jsx
6. ✓ GalleryManager.jsx
7. ✓ HeroSettings.jsx
8. ✓ BlogsManager.jsx
9. ✓ EnquiriesManager.jsx
