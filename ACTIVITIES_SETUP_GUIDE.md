# ‚úÖ Activities Section - Complete Setup Guide

## üéØ What Was Fixed

The Activities page (`/activities`) wasn't showing data from the database because:
1. The database table was missing additional fields (subtitle, duration, difficulty, etc.)
2. The admin panel wasn't saving these fields
3. The Activities page was trying to use fields that didn't exist

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updated
Added new fields to the `activities` table:
- `subtitle` (TEXT) - Short description/category
- `duration` (TEXT) - e.g., "2-3 hours"
- `difficulty` (TEXT) - Easy/Moderate/Challenging
- `group_size` (TEXT) - e.g., "4-8 people"
- `price` (TEXT) - Leave empty for included activities

### 2. Admin Panel Enhanced
Updated `ActivitiesManager.jsx` to include:
- Subtitle field
- Duration field
- Difficulty dropdown (Easy/Moderate/Challenging)
- Group size field
- Price field (empty = included with stay)

### 3. Activities Page Updated
- Now loads dynamic data from Supabase
- Separates activities into "Included" vs "Paid"
- Removed hardcoded data
- Added debug logging

## üöÄ How to Set Up

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Run the SQL from `ACTIVITIES_TABLE_UPDATE.sql`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE activities 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subtitle TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS duration TEXT DEFAULT '2-3 hours',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS difficulty TEXT DEFAULT 'Easy',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS group_size TEXT DEFAULT '4-8 people',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Add Activities via Admin Panel

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin`
2. Click **"Activities"** in the sidebar
3. Click **"Add Activity"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Title**: e.g., "Song of the Woods"
   - **Subtitle**: e.g., "Forest Walk & Nature Talk"
   - **Description**: Full description
   - **Image**: Select from image library
   - **Duration**: e.g., "2-3 hours"
   - **Difficulty**: Easy/Moderate/Challenging
   - **Group Size**: e.g., "4-8 people"
   - **Price**: Leave empty for included activities, or add price like "‚Çπ500"
   - **Display Order**: 0, 1, 2, etc. (controls order on page)
   - **Status**: Published

5. Click **"Create Activity"**

### Step 3: Verify on Frontend

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/activities`
2. You should see:
   - **Included Activities**: All activities with no price
   - **Paid Activities**: All activities with a price

## üìä How Activities Are Categorized

### Included Activities (Complimentary)
- Price field is **empty** OR
- Price is **"0"** OR
- Price contains only whitespace

These appear in the "Included Activities" section.

### Paid Activities
- Price field has **any value** (e.g., "‚Çπ500", "$20", "Price on request")

These appear in the "Paid Activities" section.

## üîç Difference: Experiences vs Activities

### Experiences Section (`/` - Home Page)
- Shows **3 activities** in a grid
- Located in `src/components/home/Experiences.jsx`
- Designed for **homepage preview**
- Uses basic fields: title, description, image

### Activities Page (`/activities`)
- Shows **ALL activities**
- Located in `src/pages/Activities.jsx`
- **Full detail page** with subtitle, duration, difficulty, etc.
- Separates **Included** vs **Paid** activities

Both pull from the **same database table** (`activities`), so:
- Add activities once in the admin panel
- They appear in both places automatically!
