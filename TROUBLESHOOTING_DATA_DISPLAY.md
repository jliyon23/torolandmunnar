## üêõ Why Data Might Not Be Showing

### Issue 1: No Data in Database
**Symptom:** Loading completes but shows "No items" message

**Solution:**
1. Go to admin panel: `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`
2. Check each manager:
   - `/admin/gallery` - Add gallery images
   - `/admin/blogs` - Add blog posts
   - `/admin/activities` - Add activities
   - `/admin/rooms` - Add rooms
3. Make sure you're adding data properly

---

### Issue 2: Items Not Published
**Symptom:** Data exists in admin panel but doesn't show on frontend

**Solution:**
1. Go to admin panel
2. Edit each item
3. **Toggle "Published" status to ON** (very important!)
4. Save the item
5. Refresh frontend page

**Gallery Images:**
- Go to `/admin/gallery`
- Each image needs `is_published = true`
- You might need to edit them individually

**Blogs:**
- Go to `/admin/blogs`
- Toggle "Published" on for each blog
- Check the publish date is not in the future

**Activities:**
- Go to `/admin/activities`
- Toggle "Published" on for each activity

**Rooms:**
- Go to `/admin/rooms`
- Toggle "Published" on for each room

---

### Issue 3: Gallery Images Missing Category/Title/Description
**Symptom:** Gallery page shows images but without proper titles or categories

**Solution:**
1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase:
   - Open Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy content from `GALLERY_ENHANCEMENT.sql`
   - Execute the SQL
2. Go to `/admin/gallery`
3. You'll need to re-add gallery images with proper details
   - OR update database records manually in Supabase

---

### Issue 4: Supabase Connection Issues
**Symptom:** Loading spinner never stops, console shows errors

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify `.env` file has correct credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
3. Restart dev server after changing `.env`:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Issue 5: Images Not Loading
**Symptom:** Data shows but images are broken or not loading

**Solution:**
1. Check image URLs in Supabase are valid Cloudinary URLs
2. Verify Cloudinary credentials in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_preset
   ```
3. Re-upload images through `/admin/images`
4. Make sure uploaded images are selected in each manager

## üîç Step-by-Step Debugging

### Debug Gallery Issues

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   ```
   F12 ‚Üí Console tab
   Look for errors related to "gallery" or "Supabase"
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   ```
   F12 ‚Üí Network tab
   Reload page
   Look for requests to Supabase
   Check if they return data
   ```

3. **Check Supabase Directly:**
   ```
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Click "Table Editor"
   - Open "gallery" table
   - Verify data exists
   - Check "is_published" column is TRUE
   ```

4. **Test API Call:**
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console on your site and run:
   const { supabaseHelpers } = await import('./src/config/supabase.js');
   const data = await supabaseHelpers.getGalleryImages();
   console.log(data);
   ```

---

### Debug Blogs Issues

1. **Check if blogs exist:**
   - Go to `/admin/blogs`
   - Verify blogs are there
   - Check "Published" toggle is ON

2. **Check publish dates:**
   - Blogs with future publish dates won't show
   - Edit blog and set date to today or earlier

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Browser console
   - Look for "blogs" or "Supabase" errors

---

### Debug Activities Issues

1. **Check if activities exist:**
   - Go to `/admin/activities`
   - Verify activities are there
   - Check "Published" toggle is ON

2. **Check pricing field:**
   - If activity has a price, it shows in "Paid Activities"
   - If price is empty or "0", it shows in "Included Activities"

---

### Debug Rooms/Stay Issues

1. **Check if rooms exist:**
   - Go to `/admin/rooms`
   - Verify rooms are there
   - Check "Published" toggle is ON

2. **Check required fields:**
   - Title (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Image URL (required)

---

## üìù Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Publish All Items at Once
**For Gallery:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE gallery SET is_published = true;
```

**For Blogs:**
```sql
UPDATE blogs SET published = true;
```

**For Activities:**
```sql
UPDATE activities SET is_published = true;
```

**For Rooms:**
```sql
UPDATE rooms SET is_published = true;
```

---

### Fix 2: Reset Gallery with Categories
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor after running GALLERY_ENHANCEMENT.sql
UPDATE gallery SET 
  category = 'nature',
  title = 'Gallery Image',
  description = 'Beautiful view',
  is_published = true;
```

---

### Fix 3: Check RLS Policies
**If data exists but still doesn't show:**

```sql
-- Check if RLS is blocking reads (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
-- This allows public read access to published content

-- For gallery
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to published gallery" ON gallery;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to published gallery" 
ON gallery FOR SELECT 
USING (is_published = true);

-- For blogs
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to published blogs" ON blogs;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to published blogs" 
ON blogs FOR SELECT 
USING (published = true);

-- For activities
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to published activities" ON activities;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to published activities" 
ON activities FOR SELECT 
USING (is_published = true);

-- For rooms
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to published rooms" ON rooms;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to published rooms" 
ON rooms FOR SELECT 
USING (is_published = true);
```
