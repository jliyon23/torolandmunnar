# üéØ ACTIVITIES SECTION - FIXED & READY

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Activities were showing in the Experiences section (homepage) but not in the dedicated Activities page (`/activities`).

**Root Cause**: The Activities page needed additional database fields (subtitle, duration, difficulty, group_size, price) that didn't exist in the original schema.

**Solution**: Extended the database schema and updated both admin panel and frontend to support full activity details.

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
**File**: `ACTIVITIES_TABLE_UPDATE.sql`
- Added `subtitle` field
- Added `duration` field (default: "2-3 hours")
- Added `difficulty` field (default: "Easy")
- Added `group_size` field (default: "4-8 people")
- Added `price` field (empty = included activity)

### 2. Admin Panel Enhanced ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/pages/admin/ActivitiesManager.jsx`
- Added subtitle input field
- Added duration input field
- Added difficulty dropdown (Easy/Moderate/Challenging)
- Added group size input field
- Added price input field with help text
- Updated form data handling for all new fields

### 3. Activities Page Updated ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/pages/Activities.jsx`
- Loads dynamic data from Supabase
- Maps all new fields correctly
- Splits activities into "Included" (no price) vs "Paid" (has price)
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Removed hardcoded activity data

## üìç Where Activities Appear

### 1. Homepage - Experiences Section
- **URL**: `/` (homepage)
- **Component**: `src/components/home/Experiences.jsx`
- **Shows**: Preview of activities (first few)
- **Fields Used**: title, description, image_url
- **Purpose**: Quick preview to entice visitors

### 2. Activities Page - Full Details
- **URL**: `/activities`
- **Component**: `src/pages/Activities.jsx`
- **Shows**: ALL activities with complete details
- **Fields Used**: title, subtitle, description, image, duration, difficulty, group_size, price
- **Sections**:
  - **Included Activities**: Free with stay (no price)
  - **Paid Activities**: Additional cost (has price)

**Both load from the same `activities` table!**

ALTER TABLE activities 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subtitle TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS duration TEXT DEFAULT '2-3 hours',

ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS group_size TEXT DEFAULT '4-8 people',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Add Activities via Admin Panel

2. Click "Activities" ‚Üí "Add Activity"

6. Click "Create Activity"

### Step 3: Verify Both Locations
