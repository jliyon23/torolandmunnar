## 📚 Documentation Created

1. ✅ **FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md** - Complete integration overview
2. ✅ **VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step verification guide
3. ✅ **TROUBLESHOOTING_DATA_DISPLAY.md** - Comprehensive troubleshooting
4. ✅ **GALLERY_ENHANCEMENT.sql** - SQL to add category/title/description to gallery

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration (If Needed)
If your gallery images need categories, titles, and descriptions:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy content from `GALLERY_ENHANCEMENT.sql`
4. Execute the SQL
5. This adds `category`, `title`, and `description` columns to gallery table

### Step 2: Ensure All Data is Published

**CRITICAL:** Data won't show on frontend unless it's marked as **Published**!

#### For Gallery Images:
1. Go to `/admin/gallery`
2. Each image should be marked as published
3. If not showing, you may need to remove and re-add them

#### For Blogs:
1. Go to `/admin/blogs`
2. Edit each blog
3. Toggle **"Published"** to ON
4. Save

#### For Activities:
1. Go to `/admin/activities`
2. Edit each activity
3. Toggle **"Published"** to ON
4. Save

#### For Rooms:
1. Go to `/admin/rooms`
2. Edit each room
3. Toggle **"Published"** to ON
4. Save

### Step 3: Quick SQL Fix (Optional)
If you want to publish everything at once:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE gallery SET is_published = true;
UPDATE blogs SET published = true;
UPDATE activities SET is_published = true;
UPDATE rooms SET is_published = true;
UPDATE testimonials SET is_published = true;
```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Go through **VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** to ensure:
- ✅ Gallery page shows images
- ✅ Blogs page shows blog posts
- ✅ Activities page shows activities
- ✅ Stay page shows rooms
- ✅ Home page shows all sections dynamically

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

2. ✅ Is data published? (Check `is_published` or `published` column)
3. ✅ Are there console errors? (Press F12)
4. ✅ Did you restart dev server? (`npm run dev`)

## 📊 How Each Page Works

### Gallery Page (`/gallery`)
```javascript
// Fetches from Supabase on load
loadGalleryImages() → getGalleryImages()
// Filters by published status
.filter(img => img.is_published)
// Maps to component format with category, title, description
// Shows loading spinner while fetching
// Shows "No images" if empty
```

### Blogs Page (`/blogs`)
```javascript
// Fetches from Supabase on load
loadBlogs() → getBlogs()
// Filters by published status
.filter(blog => blog.published)
// Shows featured blog at top
// Supports category filtering
// Shows loading spinner while fetching
```

### Activities Page (`/activities`)
```javascript
// Fetches from Supabase on load
loadActivities() → getActivities()
// Filters by published status
.filter(activity => activity.is_published)
// Separates into Included vs Paid
// Shows loading spinner while fetching
```

### Stay Page (`/stay`)
```javascript
// RoomsSection component fetches from Supabase
loadRooms() → getRooms()
// Filters by published status
.filter(room => room.is_published)
// Shows room details with images
// Shows loading spinner while fetching
```

### Home Page - About Gallery
```javascript
// About component fetches gallery images
loadGalleryImages() → getGalleryImages()
// Filters by published status
.filter(img => img.is_published)
// Optimizes images via Cloudinary
// Horizontal scrolling with arrows
```
