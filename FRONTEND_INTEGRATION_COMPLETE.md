### Gallery Section  
- Currently uses static images from `imageData.js`
- **To make dynamic:** Update to fetch from `supabaseHelpers.getGalleryImages()`

### About Section Gallery
- Uses static images from `aboutGalleryImages`
- **Could be made dynamic** with a separate admin section

## 💡 How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
Admin Panel
    ↓
  Supabase Database
    ↓
  Frontend Components
    ↓
  Website Visitors
```

1. **You add content** in admin panel
2. **Content saves** to Supabase database
3. **Frontend fetches** content on page load
4. **Visitors see** your content

### Publish/Draft System:
- **Published** (`is_published = true` or `published = true`): Visible to everyone
- **Draft** (`is_published = false` or `published = false`): Hidden from public, only visible in admin

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing?

**Check 1: Is it published?**
- Go to admin panel
- Make sure content has "Published" status (not "Draft")

**Check 2: Check browser console**
```bash
# Open browser DevTools (F12)
# Look for errors in Console tab
# Common issues:
- "Failed to fetch" → Check internet connection
- "Unauthorized" → Check Supabase credentials
- "Table does not exist" → Run SQL schema
```

**Check 3: Verify database**
- Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to Table Editor
- Check if data exists in tables:
  - `rooms`
  - `activities`
  - `testimonials`
  - `blogs`

**Check 4: Check RLS policies**
- In Supabase, go to Authentication > Policies
- Make sure "Allow public read" policies exist for each table
- For `rooms`, `activities`, `testimonials`, `blogs` tables

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Limit Number of Items

**Show only 6 testimonials:**
```javascript
const publishedTestimonials = testimonials.filter(t => t.is_published).slice(0, 6);
```

**Show all activities:**
```javascript
// Already showing all, no limit needed
```

### Change Sort Order

**Newest first:**
```javascript
const sortedBlogs = data.sort((a, b) => 
  new Date(b.created_at) - new Date(a.created_at)
);
```

**Alphabetical:**
```javascript
const sortedRooms = rooms.sort((a, b) => 
  a.title.localeCompare(b.title)
);
```

## ✨ Benefits of Dynamic Content

### Before (Static):
- ❌ Had to edit code files to change content
- ❌ Needed developer knowledge
- ❌ Required redeployment
- ❌ Risk of breaking website

### After (Dynamic):
- ✅ Update content via admin panel
- ✅ No coding required
- ✅ Instant changes (just refresh page)
- ✅ Safe and easy
- ✅ Publish/draft control
- ✅ Display order control

---

## 📊 Performance Note

**Loading States:**
All components show a loading spinner while fetching data from Supabase. This provides good user experience even on slower connections.

**Caching:**
Data is fetched fresh on each page load. For better performance in production, you can add:
- React Query for caching
- Service Workers for offline access
- Static generation at build time
