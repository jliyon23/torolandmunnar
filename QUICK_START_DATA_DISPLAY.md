ALTER TABLE gallery ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read published gallery" ON gallery;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read published gallery" ON gallery
  FOR SELECT USING (is_published = true);

ALTER TABLE blogs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read published blogs" ON blogs;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read published blogs" ON blogs
  FOR SELECT USING (published = true);

ALTER TABLE activities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read published activities" ON activities;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read published activities" ON activities
  FOR SELECT USING (is_published = true);

ALTER TABLE rooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read published rooms" ON rooms;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read published rooms" ON rooms
  FOR SELECT USING (is_published = true);
```
